# Task 1: Code Correction
# Given below are some variable assignments. 
# Your task is to identify the data type of each variable 
# and then use the type() function to print it out:

# variable_a = "Hello, World!"
# variable_b = 23
# variable_c = 3.14
# variable_d = True

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
print("variable_a's type is: ", type(variable_a))
variable_b = 23
print("variable_b's type is: ", type(variable_b))
variable_c = 3.14
print("variable_c's type is: ", type(variable_c))
variable_d = True
print("variable_d's type is: ", type(variable_d))
