# Task 1: Grocery Store Math
# Calculate the total cost of three items 
# you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices.

apple_price = 1.05
spaghetti_price = 2.55
watermelon_price = 3.25
grocery_bill = apple_price + spaghetti_price + watermelon_price
print ("if you're buying an apple for $",apple_price,", a pack of spaghetti for $",spaghetti_price,", and a watermelon for $",watermelon_price,", the grocery bill total comes to: $",grocery_bill )

print("\n")

# interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year.

savings = 1500
annual_interest = 0.04
interest_garnered = savings * annual_interest
total = savings + interest_garnered
print("if you have a savings account with $",savings, ", with an annual interest rate of ", annual_interest,"after a year your savings account will garner $",interest_garnered, " in interest, giving you a total savings value of: $", total)
